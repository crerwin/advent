Advent of Code Python solutions

![Build](https://github.com/crerwin/advent/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)

These are solutions for http://adventofcode.com/

I've checked in my inputs so I can work on this without redownloading them, but they are technically per-user.

## Setup
```
poetry install
```

## Test Example
```
poetry run pytest tests/test_2022day1.py
```

## Executing
```
poetry run advent run -y 2021 -d 1 -p 1
```
