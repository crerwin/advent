Advent of Code Python solutions

These are solutions for http://adventofcode.com/

I've checked in my inputs so I can work on this without redownloading them, but they are technically per-user.

## Setup
```
poetry install
```

## Test Example
```
poetry run pytest test/test_day10.py
```

## Executing
Specify the day number as the first (and only) argument
```
poetry run python advent.py 10
```
